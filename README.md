/ “They had been talking about astrology, a  \
| forbidden science that was not pursued in  |
| the cloister. Narcissus had said that      |
| astrology was an attempt to arrange and    |
| order the many different types of human    |
| beings according to their natures and      |
| destinies. At this point Goldmund had      |
| objected: "You're forever talking of       |
| differences - I've finally recognised a    |
| pet theory of yours. When you speak of the |
| great difference that is supposed to exist |
| between you and me, for instance, it seems |
| to me that this difference is nothing but  |
| your strange determination to establish    |
| differences."Narcissus: "Yes. You've hit   |
| the nail on the head. That's it: to you,   |
| differences are quite unimportant; to me,  |
| they are what matters most. I am a scholar |
| by nature; science is my vocation. And     |
| science is, to quote your words, nothing   |
| but the 'determination to establish        |
| differences.' Its essence couldn't be      |
| defined more accurately. For us, the men   |
| of science, nothing is as important as the |
| establishment of differences; science is   |
| the art of differentiation. Discovering in |
| every man that which distinguishes him     |
| from others is to know him.”               |

/ “He winced at her efforts to mollify him.  \
| Why didn't she say she was disgusted with  |
| his behaviour, with his long absence, his  |
| infrequent superficial letters? And if she |
| did say it - would he defend himself?      |
| Would he give reasons, try to explain how  |
| meaningless every endeavour seemed to him? |
| No. For then she would start crying again, |
| he would tell her to stop being silly, she |
| would ask for details, and he would tell   |
| her to mind her own business.”             |

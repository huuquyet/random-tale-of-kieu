 ____________________________________________
/ “Surely it is foolish to hate facts. The   \
| struggle against the past is a futile      |
| struggle. Acceptance seems so much more    |
| like wisdom. I know all this. And yet      |
| there are some facts that one must never,  |
| never accept. This is not merely an        |
| emotional matter. The reason that one must |
| hate certain facts is that one must        |
| prepare for the possibility of their       |
| return. If the past were really past, then |
| one might permit oneself an attitude of    |
| acceptance, and come away from the study   |
| of history with a feeling of serenity. But |
| the past is often only an earlier          |
| instantiation of the evil in our hearts.   |
| It is not precisely the case that history  |
| repeats itself. We repeat history—or we do |
| not repeat it, if we choose to stand in    |
| the way of its repetition. For this        |
| reason, it is one of the purposes of the   |
| study of history that we learn to oppose   |
| it.”                                       |
|                                            |

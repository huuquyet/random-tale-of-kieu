 _____________________________________________
/ “A positive attitude is most easily arrived \
| at through a deliberate and rational        |
| analysis of what’s required to manifest     |
| unwavering positive thought patterns.       |
| First, reflect on the actual, present       |
| condition of your mind. In other words, is  |
| the mind positive or not? We’ve all met     |
| individuals who perceive themselves as      |
| positive people but don’t appear as such.   |
| Since the mind is both invisible and        |
| intangible, it’s therefore easier to see    |
| the accurate characteristics of the mind    |
| through a person’s words, deeds, and        |
| posture.For example, if we say, “It’s       |
| absolutely freezing today! I’ll probably    |
| catch a cold before the end of the day!”    |
| then our words expose a negative attitude.  |
| But if we say, “The temperature is very     |
| cold” (a simple statement of fact), then    |
| our expressions, and therefore attitude,    |
| are not negative. Sustaining an alert       |
| state in which self-awareness becomes       |
| possible gives us a chance to discover the  |
| origins of negativity. In doing so, we      |
| also have an opportunity to arrive at a     |
| state of positiveness, so that our words    |
| and deeds are also positive, making others  |
| feel comfortable, cheerful, and inspired.”  |
|                                             |

/ “I guess he was right; I’m just a scorpion \
| without wings,God created me this way, no  |
| wings, just a poisonous sting,The one I    |
| loved knew my true natureShe knew I could  |
| sting her heart, and poisoned her soul,My  |
| lover knew me well, she knew my truth,She  |
| could see my poisonous soul, My ego bowed  |
| to her beauty, always ready to strike She  |
| knew my true nature, she saw the           |
| scorpion,She saw the venom in heart, she   |
| loved me still,I struck her heart multiple |
| times,I poisoned her soul with my sting,I  |
| guess he was right; I’m just a scorpion    |
| without wingsShe knew me well; she saw the |
| lethal sting,She saw her wounded heart,    |
| she loved me stillShe you loved the        |
| scorpion to the end,She fell in love, and  |
| now she’s dead,The scorpion cries, in      |
| agony, He wishes he wasn’t a venomous      |
| beast,The scorpion suffers; he misses his  |
| loved one,The one he killed, the one he    |
| stung,The one who loved him to the end”    |
|                                            |

/ “All the systems which explain so precisely \
| why the world is as it is and why it can    |
| never be otherwise, have always called      |
| forth in me the same kind of uneasiness     |
| one has when face to face with the          |
| regulations displayed under the glaring     |
| lights of a prison cell. Even if one had    |
| been born in prison and had never seen the  |
| stars or seas or woods, one would           |
| instinctively know of timeless freedom in   |
| unlimited space.My evil star, however, had  |
| fated me to be born in times when only the  |
| sharply demarcated and precisely            |
| calculable where in fashion.... "Of         |
| course, I am on the Right, on the Left, in  |
| the Centre; I descend from the monkey; I    |
| believe only what I see; the universe is    |
| going to explode at this or that speed" -   |
| we hear such remarks after the first words  |
| we exchange, from people whom we would not  |
| have expected to introduce themselves as    |
| idiots. If one is unfortunate enough to     |
| meet them again in five years, everything   |
| is different except their authoritative     |
| and mostly brutal assuredness. Now they     |
| wear a different badge in their             |
| buttonhole; and the universe now shrinks    |
| at such a speed that your hair stands on    |
| end.”                                       |
|                                             |

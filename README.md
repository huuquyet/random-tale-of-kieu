 ________________________________________________
/ “Three miles from my adopted city lies a       \
| village where I came to peace.The world        |
| there was a calm place, even the great         |
| Danube no more than a pale ribbon tossed       |
| onto the landscapeby a girl’s careless         |
| hand. Into this stillness I had been           |
| ordered to recover. The hills were gold        |
| with late summer;my rooms were two, plus a     |
| small kitchen, situated upstairs in the        |
| back of a cottage at the end of the            |
| Herrengasse. From my window I could see        |
| onto the courtyard where a linden tree         |
| twined skyward — leafy umbilicus canted        |
| toward light, warped in the very act of        |
| yearning —and I would feed on the sun as       |
| if that alone would dismantle the silence      |
| around me.At first I raged. Then music         |
| raged in me,         rising so swiftly I could |
| not write quickly enough to ease the           |
| roiling. I would stop to light a lamp, and     |
| whatever I’d missed — larks flying to          |
| nest, church bells, the shepherd’s             |
| home-toward-evening song — rushed in, and      |
| Iwould rage again. I am by nature a            |
| conflagration; I would rather leap than        |
| sit and be looked at.So when my proud city     |
| spread her gypsy skirts, I reentered,          |
| burning towards her greater, constant          |
| light.Call me rough, ill-tempered,             |
| slovenly— I tell you, every tenderness I       |
| have ever known has been nothing but           |
| thwarted violence, an ache so permanent        |
| and deep, the lightest touch awakens it. .     |
| . . It is impossible to care enough. I         |
| have returned with a second Symphony and       |
| 15 Piano Variationswhich I’ve named            |
| Prometheus,after the rogue Titan, the          |
| half-a-god who knew the worst sin is to        |
| take what cannot be given back.I smile and     |
| bow, and the world is loud. And though I       |
| dare not lean in to shout Can’t you see        |
| that I’m deaf? —I also cannot stop             |
| listening.”                                    |
|                                                |

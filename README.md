 ____________________________________________
/ “And so we know the satisfaction of hate.  \
| We know the sweet joy of revenge. How it   |
| feels good to get even. Oh, that was a     |
| nice idea Jesus had. That was a pretty     |
| notion, but you can't love people who do   |
| evil. It's neither sensible or practical.  |
| It's not wise to the world to love people  |
| who do such terrible wrong. There is no    |
| way on earth we can love our enemies.      |
| They'll only do wickedness and hatefulness |
| again. And worse, they'll think they can   |
| get away with this wickedness and evil,    |
| because they'll think we're weak and       |
| afraid. What would the world come to?But I |
| want to say to you here on this hot July   |
| morning in Holt, what if Jesus wasn't      |
| kidding? What if he wasn't talking about   |
| some never-never land? What if he really   |
| did mean what he said two thousand years   |
| ago? What if he was thoroughly wise to the |
| world and knew firsthand cruelty and       |
| wickedness and evil and hate? Knew it all  |
| so well from personal firsthand            |
| experience? And what if in spite of all    |
| that he knew, he still said love your      |
| enemies? Turn your cheek. Pray for those   |
| who misuse you. What if he meant every     |
| word of what he said? What then would the  |
| world come to?And what if we tried it?     |
| What if we said to our enemies: We are the |
| most powerful nation on earth. We can      |
| destroy you. We can kill your children. We |
| can make ruins of your cities and villages |
| and when we're finished you won't even     |
| know how to look for the places where they |
| used to be. We have the power to take away |
| your water and to scorch your earth, to    |
| rob you of the very fundamentals of life.  |
| We can change the actual day into actual   |
| night. We can do these things to you. And  |
| more.But what if we say, Listen: Instead   |
| of any of these, we are going to give      |
| willingly and generously to you. We are    |
| going to spend the great American national |
| treasure and the will and the human lives  |
| that we would have spent on destruction,   |
| and instead we are going to turn them all  |
| toward creation. We'll mend your roads and |
| highways, expand your schools, modernize   |
| your wells and water supplies, save your   |
| ancient artifacts and art and culture,     |
| preserve your temples and mosques. In      |
| fact, we are going to love you. And again  |
| we say, no matter what has gone before, no |
| matter what you've done: We are going to   |
| love you. We have set our hearts to it. We |
| will treat you like brothers and sisters.  |
| We are going to turn our collective        |
| national cheek and present it to be        |
| stricken a second time, if need be, and    |
| offer it to you. Listen, we--But then he   |
| was abruptly halted.”                      |
|                                            |

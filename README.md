/ “It's because I haven't courage,' said     \
| Samuel. 'I could never quite take the      |
| responsibility. When the Lord God did not  |
| call my name, I might have called his name |
| - but I did not. There you have the        |
| difference between greatness and           |
| mediocrity. It's not an uncommon disease.  |
| But it's nice for a mediocre man to know   |
| that greatness must be the loneliest state |
| in the world.''I'd think there are degrees |
| of greatness,' Adam said.'I don't think    |
| so,' said Samuel. 'That would be like      |
| saying there is a little bigness. No. I    |
| believe when you come to that              |
| responsibility the hugeness and you are    |
| alone to make your choice. On one side you |
| have warmth and companionship and sweet    |
| understanding, and on the other - cold,    |
| lonely greatness. There you make your      |
| choice. I'm glad I chose mediocrity, but   |
| how am I to say what reward might have     |
| come with the other? None of my children   |
| will be great either, except perhaps Tom.  |
| He's suffering over the choosing right     |
| now. It's a painful thing to watch. And    |
| somewhere in me I want him to say yes.     |
| Isn't that strange? A father to want his   |
| son condemned to greatness! What           |
| selfishness that must be.”                 |

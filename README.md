/ “I would respect feminist who said "Single \
| moms, are you kidding me? Stop taking      |
| government benefits because, the           |
| government is the patriarchy. So, you are  |
| taking things from the patriarchy so you   |
| dont have to be responsible. Any woman who |
| takes money from the government using cops |
| who usually extract it from men by force   |
| is not a feminist. Is a exceedingly bad    |
| bride of the state." I would admire that   |
| but, of course feminism doesn't have       |
| anything to do with any of that            |
| stuff.Look, it's fine. Have your fun. Make |
| fun of men. Go for it. Yea, we're all      |
| idiots, we're all selfish, greedy          |
| bastards. Ok, it's fine because the        |
| government is going to run out of money    |
| soon and then all these woman are going to |
| try to find some guy to latch onto when    |
| the benefits stop flowing and I mean, you  |
| saw this happening with the soviet union.  |
| "Now we need you! You guys are great! We   |
| missed you so much! Give me some           |
| money!"It's just a bunch of noise from a   |
| bunch of people who are stealing from the  |
| productive.”                               |

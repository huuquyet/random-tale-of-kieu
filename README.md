/ “Me dad planted that tree,’ she said       \
| absently, pointing out through the old     |
| cracked window.The great beech filled at   |
| least half the sky and shook shadows all   |
| over the house.Its roots clutched the      |
| slope like a giant hand, holding the hill  |
| in place. Its trunk writhed with power,    |
| threw off veils of green dust, rose        |
| towering into the air, branched into a     |
| thousand shaded alleys, became a city for  |
| owls and squirrels. I had thought such     |
| trees to be as old as the earth, I never   |
| dreamed that a man could make them. Yet it |
| was Granny Trill’s dad who had planted     |
| this tree, had thrust in the seed with his |
| finger. How old must he have been to leave |
| such a mark? Think of Granny’s age, and    |
| add his on top, and you were back at the   |
| beginning of the world.”                   |

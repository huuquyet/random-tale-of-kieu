 _____________________________________________
/ “To a Christian, the dastardly liberals are \
| not so much villains as victims. It's not   |
| their fault they're possessed by demons.    |
| But if I felt a slight diminishing of       |
| hostility, I also saw any hope of mutual    |
| accommodation go up in a blast of           |
| sulfurous smoke...these days, much of what  |
| liberals really anguish about behind        |
| closed doors is how to find common ground   |
| with people of faith. And now I realized    |
| that for at least some people, common       |
| ground will never be possible because they  |
| don't object to specific ideas that can be  |
| reframed or adjusted. They object to        |
| Satan, whose bidding we are doing. They     |
| may not hate us - they may believe they     |
| love us - but they hate him, and they       |
| won't negotiate with him either. We want    |
| to persuade them, reason with them, listen  |
| to them, and accommodate them. They want    |
| to save us. It's not even the same playing  |
| field.”                                     |
|                                             |
